I'm liking Crafty.  I've just gone through a tutorial and now I've been figuring out how to mod it to my own game.  So far so good, I get the component/entity approach, the main thing now is figuring out how to do specifics things I run into.  The documentatoin is only so so, but there's enough online and a few good samples and tutorials.

As of now, I have a simple, working game (very stripped features!).

My plan is to move forward with Crafty.  I'm going to fork this into a new repo and work from there from this point on.

At some point, maybe on another project, I'd like to still look at Enchant and Easel.
